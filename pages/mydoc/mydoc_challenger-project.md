> CONFIGURE
> 
Integrated configurator allows you easily install and configure GCS 300 Autopilot specifically for your vehicle type in less than 10 minutes from the scratch. Various settings provide extremely flexible configuration to meet any requirements. (This is closed source software) This software would be based on qground station or other software.

> PLAN
> 
Creating the flight plan has never been easier - simply tap and drag & drop to place the waypoints and adjust various mission parameters. Intuitive planning interface allows you generating complex missions with no efforts.

> FLY
> 
Monitor various flight parameters of the system and adjust the plan during the mission. In case something is not right GCS will automatically notify you and suggest the available actions. Real-time video feed is integrated right in the app.

> ANALYZE
> 
All flights data is stored in GCS and can be easily accessed for mission replay and parameters analysis. Payload data acquisition can be tightly integrated with the flight data. This allows you concentrating on the mission, not the flight.

> Air Map integrated
> 
GCS has integrated services from Air Map - the world's leading airspace management platform for drones. Air Map connects drone operators with airspace authorities to enable safe, efficient, and scalable drone operations through core UTM services

> Fleet Control
> 
Unlimited number of drones supported simultaneously with super easy and intuitive control. Just as example, put a couple of drones for an autonomous survey mission while the third one is monitoring what they do.
