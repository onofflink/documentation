## Overview

I was on a mission to join the workforce; my portfolio and projects have grown very fast 
for the last three months. They are purely based on the fictional ideas and themes I created for the purpose of my portfolio and projects.

If credits I have inserted along the way are not enough to satisfy the standards of business or not fulfilling the required criteria, please allow me to apologize and I will do my best to amend and reflect or scrap away the questionable projects entirely. I owe everything to you and my teachers.

On Mar 8, 2019 as I wrap up my NCS course and join Onofflink for my first stint in a real job. This is the beginning of my developer career.
