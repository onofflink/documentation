Building for Bebop 2
====================

These instructions explain how to use ArduPilot for the
`Bebop2 <https://www.parrot.com/us/drones/parrot-bebop-2?ref=#parrot-bebop-2-details/>`__ on a Linux
machine. The Bebop 2 is based on the same architecture as the Bebop with
a few noticeable changes, not the least being a much better quality GPS
(UBlox GPS with a bigger antenna).

.. warning::

   Making the changes described in this article will void your
   warranty! Parrot's technical support will not help you with this hack or
   to recover your original software.

.. warning::

   Hacking a commercial product is risky! This software is still evolving.

   That said, it is almost always possible to recover a drone and members
   of the ardupilot dev team can likely help people hacking or recovering
   their Bebop on `this google group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bebop-ardupilot>`__.

Building ArduCopter for Bebop 2
===============================

.. tip::

   You can skip this step if you just want to try out the
   (experimental) binary version.

The following steps show how to build a custom version of the Copter
software for Bebop 2:

Install armhf toolchain
-----------------------

#. Install Parrot's version of linaro *arm-linux-gnueabihf* toolchain that can be downloaded from
   `here <https://firmware.parrot.com/Toolchains/parrot-tools-linuxgnutools-2016.02-linaro_1.0.0-5_amd64.deb>`__

#. Install it (the toolchain will be extracted in /opt)

   ::

       sudo dpkg -i parrot-tools-linuxgnutools-2016.02-linaro_1.0.0-5_amd64.deb

#. Add the path to the toolchain to the PATH variable

   ::

       export PATH=/opt/arm-2016.02-linaro/bin:$PATH

Download and compile ArduCopter
-------------------------------

#. Clone ardupilot repository

   ::

       git clone https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot.git
       cd ardupilot
       git submodule update --init --recursive

#. Building the flight control firmware is nearly identical for
   :ref:`building for the Pixhawk <building-px4-with-make>`
   except the build command is:
#. ::

       ./waf configure --board=bebop
       ./waf build


Uploading the Firmware
======================

Mission Planner can now upload stable and custom versions of ardupilot to the Bebop2.

..  youtube:: Ir0DyvlbTM0
    :width: 100%

Instructions below are for the manual method of uploading

#. Install adb (android debug tool):

   ::

       sudo apt-get install android-tools-adb

#. Connect to the Bebop2's WiFi network (BebopDrone-XXXX).
#. Enable adb server by pressing the power button 4 times.
#. Connect to the Bebop's adb server on port 9050:

   ::

       adb connect 192.168.42.1:9050

#. If the previous command returns an error, try again (press the power
   button 4 times and retry).
#. Remount the system partition as writeable:

   ::

       adb shell mount -o remount,rw /

#. Push the stripped arducopter binary to the Bebop2:

   ::

       adb mkdir /data/ftp/internal_000/APM
       adb push arducopter /data/ftp/internal_000/APM/

Starting ArduPilot
==================

#. Kill the regular autopilot:

   ::

       adb shell
       kk

#. Launch Copter:

   ::

       cd /data/ftp/internal_000/APM
       arducopter -A udp:192.168.42.255:14550:bcast -B /dev/ttyPA1 -C udp:192.168.42.255:14551:bcast -l /data/ftp/internal_000/APM/logs -t /data/ftp/internal_000/APM/terrain

Launch Copter at startup
========================

As for Bebop, modify the init script **/etc/init.d/rcS_mode_default**.
Comment the following line:

::

    DragonStarter.sh -out2null &

Replace it with:

::

    /data/ftp/internal_000/APM/arducopter -A udp:192.168.42.255:14550:bcast -B /dev/ttyPA1 -C udp:192.168.42.255:14551:bcast -l /data/ftp/internal_000/APM/logs -t /data/ftp/internal_000/APM/terrain &

#. Enable adb server by pressing the power button 4 times.
#. Connect to adb server as described before:

   ::

       adb connect 192.168.42.1:9050

#. Re-mount the system partition as writeable:

   ::

       adb shell mount -o remount,rw /

#. In order to avoid editing the file manually, you can download `this one <https://github.com/Parrot-Developers/ardupilot/releases/download/bebop-v0.1/rcS_mode_default>`__.
#. Save the original one and push this one to the bebop
#. ::

       adb shell cp /etc/init.d/rcS_mode_default /etc/init.d/rcS_mode_default_backup
       adb push rcS_mode_default /etc/init.d/

#. Sync and reboot:

   ::

       adb shell sync
       adb shell reboot

Recovery
========

For recovery, you can use the same cable as the one used on Bebop, see
:ref:`here <building-for-bebop-on-linux_recovery>`.

#. Remove the two screws using a torx T6 screwdriver 

   .. image:: ../images/bebop_remove_screws.jpg
      :target: ../_images/bebop_remove_screws.jpg
   
#. Remove the neck by pulling it towards the front of the Bebop

   .. image:: ../images/bebop_recovery_remove_neck.jpg
       :target: ../_images/bebop_recovery_remove_neck.jpg
   
#. The UART connector is located on the right side
   
   .. image:: ../images/bebop_uart_connection.jpg
       :target: ../_images/bebop_uart_connection.jpg
   
#. Plug the cable with the black wire at the front
   
   .. image:: ../images/bebop_connections3.jpg
       :target: ../_images/bebop_connections3.jpg
   
#. Connect to the bebop with the UART port using any terminal emulator
#. Copy the backup rcS file back to its place

   ::

       mount -o remount,rw /
       cp /etc/init.d/rcS_mode_default_backup /etc/init.d/rcS_mode_default

#. Sync and reboot

   ::

       sync
       reboot

Flying and RC over UDP
======================

Flying and RC over UDP instructions are the same as :ref:`the ones for Bebop <building-for-bebop-on-linux_flying>`

Basic configuration and frame parameters
========================================

#. The set of tuning parameters can be found
   `here <https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/Tools/Frame_params/Parrot_Bebop2.param>`__.
   These are not yet fully tuned for Bebop 2
#. In order to do the basic configuration and calibration, you can use
   any of the GCSs and perform:

   #. Magnetometer Calibration
   #. RC Calibration
   #. Accelerometer Calibration

Additional information
======================

The loiter mode quality is very good compared to the first Bebop because
of the (much better) UBlox GPS. It is now safe to takeoff and land in
the mode you want.

There is still no support for video yet and the optical flow and sonar
are currently under development.

This is a good time to participate and help improve them!


## bebop firmware flashing with UART 

Here is my procedure once you get your usb cable with PIN ID tied to 1.
Then download the 2 archives here :
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EWS_rFyLK9QZU39achJWOpyjjL1K6jQP?usp=sharing 28
```bash
mkdir ~/parrot
cp Bebop_Tools.tar.gz ~/parrot
cd ~/parrot
tar -xvf Bebop_Tools.tar.gz
sudo dpkg -i parrot-tools-installer-flashtools_5.9.47_all.deb
mkdir ~/.pinstrc
cp milos_linux_installer.tar.gz ~/.pinstrc
cd ~/.pinstrc
tar -xvf milos_linux_installer.tar.gz
```

Then unplug the battery of your bebop 2, plug the special USB cable.
Type `sudo pinst_usb milos linux installer`
Press the power button on your bebop 2.
Normally you should see messages on the console telling you the flashing is currently ongoing.
Scan Parrot ROM…
```

And then you are done, though your bebop has gone back to an old version so you should update it asap to a more recent firmware version.

## _swarming:

Swarming
========

Swarming/Formation-Flying Interface (Beta)
==========================================

![Belkin_hub](https://ardupilot.org/planner/_images/radiohub.jpg)

.. image:: ../images/radiohub.jpg
    :target: ../_images/radiohub.jpg

Mission Planner supports limited "swarming", or formation-flying with
multiple UAVs.  At the moment this is in an experimental beta
implementation, which is admittedly neither easy to use nor 100%
reliable. However, if you're interested in multiple-UAV coordination,
this is a good place to start.

More sophisticated swarming/multiple-UAV control is available in
QGroundControl and APM Planner 2.0, which are both built on a
multiple-vehicle architecture. But Mission Planner accomplishes this in
a limited way by simply opening multiple serial port MAVLink connections
simultaneously (see four-UAV USB hub above) and passing GPS position
information from one ("leader", flying in any mode, from manual to auto)
to the other ("followers", flying in Guided mode). The GPS position of
the leader is adjusted by a set offset and then sent to the followers as
a series of dynamic waypoints.  In this fashion the followers will
follow the leader at set X,Y and Z offset distances.

This interface can be entered by pressing Control-F in the Mission
Planner. That will bring up a pretty crowded box of buttons (see below),
but the key ones are marked below: identifying the serial port of the
"follower" UAVs, and the "swarm" button, which will bring up the second
window, with a grid showing the relative position offset of the other
UAVs.

![swarm_button](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot_wiki/raw/master/planner/source/images/mp_screen_with_swarming_button.png)

.. figure:: ../images/mp_screen_with_swarming_button.png
   :target: ../_images/mp_screen_with_swarming_button.png

   Mission Planner: Screen with SwarmButton

**Setup Procedure:**

#. Plug in one 3DR radio per vehicle
#. Connect to the "leader" in the Mission Planner
#. Press Control-F and click "swarm"
#. Click "set leader"
#. Click "Connect MAVs" ("MAV" stands for "micro air vehicle"). Click it
   once for each MAV. As each connects via MAVLink they will appear on
   the grid
#. Drag the MAV circles around the grid to set the desired offsets. The
   Mission Planner assumes that "up" is North.
#. "Start" will start sending Guided Mode waypoints to all vehicles
   except the leader.

Now, as you may have guessed, getting the starting position can be the
hardest. In the grid they are identified by the MAV number and COM port.
It's a good idea to tape that MAV number to the physical vehicles
themselves, so you can correspond the on-screen numbers and grid
position with the physical layout of the vehicles on the ground.

Currently the code does no path prediction etc. A good place to start is
with two quadcopters about 20 m apart to test, and work up from there.

**First Flight:**

#. Take off with the leader, sit at say 2-10 m high (loiter). The leader
   flight mode doesn’t matter
#. Click start. This should make the follower take off in guided mode
   (it will take 3-5 seconds to launch) and sit at the same altitude as
   the master (assuming you haven't changed the altitude offsets)
#. Manually move the leaders, and the 2nd quad (follower) should follow.
#. When you're done, manually land the leader. Use the "Land" button to
   tell the follower to land, too.


**Tips**


-  Don't close the swarming screen, as it will stop the swarming. (Since
   we use guided mode, if you do the quad will just sit at the last
   commanded location.)
-  The main map interface will show both quads.
-  If you drag the quad around the grid screen, while it's active. the
   quad should actually move as well.
-  Increase the position stream rate in the mp. config>planner>position.
   to say 5, from the default of 3. to reduce the latency
