```bash
ssh root@159.65.8.44
# gitlab-rails console
#  user = User.find_by_username 'exampleuser'

#or

 user = User.find(123)

#or

 user = User.find_by(email: 'onofftony@gmail.com')

 user.password = 'secret_pass'
 user.password_confirmation = 'secret_pass'

 user.send_only_admin_changed_your_password_notification!
 user.save!
```

#### in case password reset doesn't appear to work;

> skip the reconfirmation feature as in below

```
 user = User.find(1)
 user.skip_reconfirmation!
```

> If the username was changed to something else and has been forgotten, one possible way is to reset the password using Rails console with user ID 1 (in almost all the cases, the first user is the default admin account).
