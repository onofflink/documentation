### checklist and indicator status
- Servo power will shut off 3 seconds after the landing gear has reached its target position. 
- When powering on the system, if the transmitter switch is in the [Upper] position, the LED will flash red quickly as a warning. Toggle the switch to the [Lower] position to continue. 
- If there is an abnormal signal or no signal input into the “IN” port, the LED will slowly flash red. Check receiver and connections for problems. 
- If servo power consumption is too high, the LED will light up red. If this lasts more than 4 seconds, the landing gear will lower and the LED will flash green slowly. Re-calibration is needed beforeflying.
- A2 flight control system users can use the A2 Assistant to set intelligent gear on the “Advanced” page. Refer to the “A2 user manual” for details
