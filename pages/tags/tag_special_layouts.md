## how to set up and connect IDE

1. Connect the board to your PC

- To upload 

Arduino sketches the IntelÂ® Edison board must be powered up and connected to your computer. It is suggested to use two micro USB cables to connect the board to your PC because in this way more current is available if needed.

Find the microswitch in between the USB ports on the expansion board. Switch the microswitch down towards the micro-USB ports, if it isn't already, as shown in the figure below:

- A green light should light up on the expansion board. If it does not, check your connection

</div>

- you are all set to rock!!
